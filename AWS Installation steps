==========================

Configuration file
Certain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file (ansible.cfg). The stock configuration should be sufficient for most users, but there may be reasons you would want to change them. Paths where configuration file is searched are listed in reference documentation.

Getting the latest configuration
If installing Ansible from a package manager, the latest ansible.cfg file should be present in /etc/ansible, possibly as a .rpmnew file (or other) as appropriate in the case of updates.

If you installed Ansible from pip or from source, you may want to create this file in order to override default settings in Ansible.
